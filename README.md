## Check Brackets Sequence
I started this out by breaking down the problem into the necessary steps. My steps are very explicit. I looked at the solution and Lo! what a creative solution! I played around with that one and posted that as v2. I liked that I checked for whether all the characters were the opening or closing bracket, so I left that in v2.
